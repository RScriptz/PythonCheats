Thanks for using SuperCheat for Supermarket Simulator! In order to run it you must do the following things:

- Open the 'Installer.bat' file to install the python modules (skip this step if you have the required modules)
- Run the 'SuperCheat.bat' file to start the cheat! To use cheats type in the corresponding number then the value you wish it to be modified to!

All the backups made using this cheat will be located in the 'Backups' folder. In order to replace your old save file with the one thats backed up you need to rename the backup to SaveFile, then go to 'AppData\LocalLow\Nokta Games\Supermarket Simulator' and replace the SaveFile.es3 file.
If you don't know how to get to that path open the 'run' app (find it using the windows searchbar) then type in appdata, open the 'LocalLow' folder then locate and open the 'Nokta Games' folder, then open the 'Supermarket Simulator' folder and replace the file as said above.
